## Introduction

Engineering design involves solving complex optimization problems to innovate systems such as aircraft wings or mechanical components. Traditionally, **forward design** entails predicting the behavior of a system from given inputs, while **inverse design** seeks inputs that yield a desired outcome. The latter has applications in fields like aerospace, nanotechnology, and materials science, where it aids in achieving optimized designs under stringent constraints.

Recent advances in machine learning have accelerated inverse design. Traditional approaches, such as physics-based solvers, are computationally intensive. Neural surrogate models have emerged as efficient alternatives, offering scalability in optimization tasks.

## Background

### Inverse Design

Inverse design is a critical problem across engineering disciplines, where the goal is to determine the optimal input parameters to achieve a desired outcome. Unlike forward design, which predicts the system's behavior based on known inputs, inverse design involves deducing inputs that optimize an objective function under constraints. This process is essential in domains such as aerospace, robotics, and materials science for developing highly efficient and innovative designs.

For instance, in the aerospace industry, inverse design can optimize the shape of an aircraft wing to reduce drag and enhance fuel efficiency. Similarly, in materials science, it is used to create nanostructures with specific optical properties. However, the challenge lies in the complexity of simulating physical systems, as these often involve high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics. Classical approaches, like sampling-based optimization or adjoint solvers, can be computationally expensive and fail to generalize to novel scenarios.

### Neural Surrogate Model Approach

To overcome the limitations of classical methods, neural surrogate models have emerged as a promising alternative. These models approximate the forward dynamics of a system, replacing traditional simulators with faster, learnable approximations. Once trained on data generated from a physical simulator, the surrogate model predicts the system's trajectory for given input conditions.

The inverse design process using neural surrogates typically involves:

1. **Learning Forward Dynamics**: The surrogate model is trained to predict system trajectories by minimizing errors against simulation data.
2. **Backpropagation for Optimization**: Design inputs are optimized by propagating gradients through the surrogate model and adjusting parameters to minimize a predefined design objective.

#### Advantages

- **Speed**: Neural surrogate models enable rapid evaluations compared to classical simulators.
- **Scalability**: They can handle large datasets and complex design problems efficiently.

#### Limitations

While effective, this approach is not without flaws. Over-optimization on surrogate models can lead to **adversarial minima**, where the designs exploit inaccuracies in the model, resulting in solutions that are mathematically valid but physically infeasible. Additionally, surrogate models often struggle with **out-of-distribution generalization**, as they fail to predict accurately for input conditions significantly different from the training data.

## Compositional Generative Inverse Design (CinDM)

### Method Setup

CinDM redefines inverse design as a generative problem, using energy-based diffusion models. It optimizes both design objectives and energy consistency, ensuring solutions align with training data distributions. Key features of CinDM include:

1. **Energy-Based Models**: These models define a joint distribution over trajectories and design parameters, capturing physical constraints.
2. **Compositionality**: By composing energy functions for system subcomponents, CinDM enables generalization to unseen, complex systems.

The optimization process involves:

- Sampling design variables from noise.
- Iterative refinement using a denoising diffusion model.
- Joint optimization of trajectories and boundaries.
